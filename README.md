# camcal_validation
Code and dataset to validate distance measured from camera traps using calibration tools 

## Details
1. camera_deloyment_validation.csv - Dataset with the 10 camera deployed for the validation of the calibration model
2. pole_11_mod_param.csv - Model parameters from the non-linear least square and surface details of the 10 camera locations for validation purpose
3. CTtracking_err.r - R codes to analyse the camera calibration dataset and estimate radius and speed with radius_err and speed_err
4. Speed_seq_data.csv - Dataset of the speed sequences 
5. Camcal_validation_code.R - R code to simulate the effective detection distance and  speed from the camera-trap detections 
6. Site_digitisation_data.csv - Dataset contians the digitised coordinate from images for a reliastic representation of digitised object location in camera traps
